List existing ATLAS and CMS searches for Z' with missing energy. Explain why ATLAS mono-jet should give leading bounds.
1: strong coupling points to monojet, cite~\cite{Bernreuther:2018nat}. 2: Some subtleties in CMS study \JZ{Clarify!}

Summarize the ATLAS search and its validation. Explain with care rescaling factors.

Explain we have verified the expected beahviour of the shape and cross section with the couplings, which allows to make reinterpretations with arbitrary parameters.

Put forward which parameters alter the shape, and which ones do not.

Complain about lack of reinterpretation data in ATLAS paper (exclusive vs inclusive). As it stands, it does not allow for full reinterpretation, even within Z' model.
