# zprime-explorer-2.0

Z prime explorer 2.0 is a program which allows the user to test their Z' model against current LHC searches. These searches include dijet and dilepton searches as well as mono-X (where X=jet, W, Z, Higgs, photons...).

The program is user friendly and one has to provide only the interactions of the Z' with the SM particles or dark matter particles (if the model includes this).
